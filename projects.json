This project allowed me to delve into the potential of AI to unleash creativity in image generation, with some of the images showcased on this page serving as proof of its capabilities. As barriers to image generation regarding overall coherency and size limitations continue to diminish, this project represents a small yet significant step in staying at the forefront of digital innovation. Who knows, it might even assist with visualisations in my future work."

                "description" : "Taking on the challenge of delving into more intricate mathematical concepts using Python, I developed a rather cool symmetric encryption algorithm. The algorithm operates similarly to a Caesar Cipher, but with the key difference being that the shift value and sequence change for every character in the input text. What this means is by providing key and text inputs, users receive a unique encrypted result each time, even when using the same key and input text. This project served as a random but very valuable learning experience that pushed the boundaries of my mathematical and Python abilities. This project also really served as an opportunity for me to explore just how complex the world of cryptography is."
